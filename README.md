# FriendFinder

## Overview

Friend Finder is a compatibility-based full-stack application which takes user input from the application survey and runs compatibility logic to return the users best friend match.

This application was created by Elvia Franco for UAGIL201905FSF2. 

## Heroku Link


## Motivation 
This particular project is my first experience with building a full-stack application and I was motivated by the challenge to understand and apply how client-side requests relate to server-side responses. 

## Tech Used
* Express.js
* Node.js
* Path npm package
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
